# Lyme Disease

Guess what, I got Lyme disease.

This is a tough illness to overcome, so I have written my story here. There is much information about
Lyme disease on the internet, and here is mine.

## What is Lyme disease?

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection, most commonly spread by ticks. Ticks are small arthropods - creatures with a hard outer skeleton - 1-5 mm in length with 8 small legs and are parasitic. They feed by drinking blood. Ticks themselves are unpleasant but not per say dangerous, but they carry a number of very unpleasant infections, including Borrelia.

Borrelia are a family of bacteria, and include various subspecies including Borrelia burgdorerfi, Borralia azfelii and Borrelia garnii. I'll just say _Borrelia_ unless I mean a particular species.

Lyme disease (LD), or Lyme borreliosis (LB), is the set of symptoms caused by being infected with Lyme bacteria, or just _Lyme_. In addition, there are a number of related terms, such as MSIDS (multi-system infectious disease symdrome), post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) and "chronic" Lyme disease.

I am very sympathetic to the idea of post-treatment chronic Lyme disease, but be aware that your regular physician may not be, and you need to be able to communicate with them correctly and respectfully.

## How do you catch Lyme disease?

The main way to catch Lyme disease is to be bitten by a tick that is carrying Borrelia bacteria. Bacteria in the mouth and guts of the tick pass into your blood stream, and infect you. There is no minimum period that the tick needs to be attached, but some suggest it is more likely to spread to you if the tick has been attached for many hours, and has a chance to embed itself in your skin. 

### Safe tick removal
You are also more likely to get infected if you clumsily remove the tick, which can cause the contents of the tick to be squirted into your own blood stream. For these reasons, always use fine-nosed tweezers beneath the tick, or use a tick twizzler. Do not scratch, scrape, aggravate or squeeze a tick. Collect the tick in a sample bag (in case you want to get it tested), dispose of it properly, and disinfect your fingers and tools thoroughly afterwards.

Lyme disease can also spread congenitally (from mother to baby), sexually, or between family members. Always use a condom if you are untreated or not on antibiotics, and perhaps always. These other vectors are anecdotal and rarer but it is better to be safe than sorry.

Other biting insects can carry Lyme disease but this is also much rarer and makes diagnosis even more difficult.

## Symptoms

Lyme disease mimics a variety of other conditions which makes it very hard to accurately diagnose. Unfortunately the standard test for Lyme disease is mired in controversy.

Following a tick bite, perhaps a a few days to a few weeks, you can experience a spreading rash (erythema migrans), and get flu-like symptoms. Like flu, you can get heavy joints, feel generally unwell, and a few weeks after infection you can get symptoms in your joints, inflamed joints, an swollen knee nerve pain, numbness in your head and face, a drooping face, and rarer, chest pain. You can also go on to develop confusion, "brain fog", neck pains, pains, and sleep disturbances.

However, many of the symptoms can be absent or very mild, and are very general. Lyme disease is in many cases self-limiting, does not cause long term problems, and resolves by itself. It is extremely important than you are able to treat Lyme disease early if you can associate any of these milder general symptoms with a tick bite, as early treatment is essential for a good outcome.

Unfortunately, a proportion of cases can lead to serious life-changing consequences for the sufferer, so to describe Lyme disease as generally mild is extremely misleading.

## Diagnosis

Through vigilance, many cases of Lyme disease can be caught and treated early. But often the sufferer is ignorant of Lyme disease and many not get treated promptly, many not remember a specific tick bite, and may not have developed a rash.

Then, the patient has a range of non-specific symptoms, and unfortnately may only be tested for Lyme disease at a very late stage. There is a standard blood test for Lyme disease, but there are many problems with it.
