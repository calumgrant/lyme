# Lyme Disease

Guess what, I got Lyme disease.

This is a tough illness to overcome, so I have written my story here. There is much information about
Lyme disease on the internet, and here is mine.

## What is Lyme disease?

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection, most commonly spread by ticks. Ticks are small arthropods - creatures with a hard outer skeleton - 1-5 mm in length with 8 small legs and are parasitic. They feed by drinking blood. Ticks themselves are unpleasant but not per say dangerous, but they carry a number of very unpleasant infections, including Borrelia.

Borrelia are a family of bacteria, and include various subspecies including Borrelia burgdorerfi, Borralia azfelii and Borrelia garnii. I'll just say _Borrelia_ unless I mean a particular species.

Lyme disease (LD), or Lyme borreliosis (LB), is the set of symptoms caused by being infected with Lyme bacteria, or just _Lyme_. In addition, there are a number of related terms, such as MSIDS (multi-system infectious disease symdrome), post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) and "chronic" Lyme disease.

Specific illnesses of Lyme disease may incluce "Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme arthritis, Lyme carditis" etc to indicate that the condition has been caused by Lyme disease.

I am very sympathetic to the idea of post-treatment chronic Lyme disease, but be aware that your regular physician may not be, and you need to be able to communicate with them correctly and respectfully.

## How do you catch Lyme disease?

The main way to catch Lyme disease is to be bitten by a tick that is carrying Borrelia bacteria. Bacteria in the mouth and guts of the tick pass into your blood stream, and infect you. There is no minimum period that the tick needs to be attached, but some suggest it is more likely to spread to you if the tick has been attached for many hours, and has a chance to embed itself in your skin. 

### Safe tick removal
You are also more likely to get infected if you clumsily remove the tick, which can cause the contents of the tick to be squirted into your own blood stream. For these reasons, always use fine-nosed tweezers beneath the tick, or use a tick twizzler. Do not scratch, scrape, aggravate or squeeze a tick. Collect the tick in a sample bag (in case you want to get it tested), dispose of it properly, and disinfect your fingers and tools thoroughly afterwards.

Lyme disease can also spread congenitally (from mother to baby), sexually, or between family members. Always use a condom if you are untreated or not on antibiotics, and perhaps always. These other vectors are anecdotal and rarer but it is better to be safe than sorry.

Other biting insects can carry Lyme disease but this is also much rarer and makes diagnosis even more difficult.

## Symptoms

Lyme disease mimics a variety of other conditions which makes it very hard to accurately diagnose. Unfortunately the standard test for Lyme disease is mired in controversy.

Following a tick bite, perhaps a a few days to a few weeks, you can experience a spreading rash (erythema migrans), and get flu-like symptoms. Like flu, you can get heavy joints, feel generally unwell, and a few weeks after infection you can get symptoms in your joints, inflamed joints, an swollen knee nerve pain, numbness in your head and face, a drooping face, and rarer, chest pain. You can also go on to develop confusion, "brain fog", neck pains, pains, and sleep disturbances.

However, many of the symptoms can be absent or very mild, and are very general. Lyme disease is in many cases self-limiting, does not cause long term problems, and resolves by itself. It is extremely important than you are able to treat Lyme disease early if you can associate any of these milder general symptoms with a tick bite, as early treatment is essential for a good outcome.

Unfortunately, a proportion of cases can lead to serious life-changing consequences for the sufferer, so to describe Lyme disease as generally mild is extremely misleading.

## Diagnosis

Through vigilance, many cases of Lyme disease can be caught and treated early. But often the sufferer is ignorant of Lyme disease and many not get treated promptly, many not remember a specific tick bite, and may not have developed a rash.

Then, the patient has a range of non-specific symptoms, and unfortnately may only be tested for Lyme disease at a very late stage. GPs generally do not consider Lyme disease as a differential diagnosis, or may have learnt to be dismissive about Lyme disease. 

The standard NHS criteria for diagnosing Lyme disease are:

- A tick bite, a characteritic rash, and the onset of symptoms
- Exposure to ticks, symptoms and a positive blood test.

### Problems with the standard diagnosis

Many people would not recognise a tick, or do not know if they have been bitten by one or whether it was attached or not. Symptoms can be delayed so there is no connection with a tick bite. Doctors do not consider asking patients if they have been bitten by anything.

The rash is in many cases absent or unclear, or may have resolved by the time the patient sees the doctor, and the rash can be confused with many other skin conditions.

Symptoms are too unspecific to be able to accurately confirm Lyme disease in many cases.

This leaves the blood test. Many patients or doctors would not even know to ask to be tested for Lyme disease, and can have their concerns dismissed as hysteria.

Testing for Lyme disease is done by a two stage process, the ELISA and the Western Blot. Both of these tests measure the body's immune response to Borrelia which can take time to build up, and can produce many false-negatives. Also Borrelia baceria seem attack the immune system and make it hard for the body to produce suffiient antibioties - and therefore the correct immune response to the blood test.

The blood test cannot say when treatment has been successfully completed because it does not measure the bacteria directly.

Finally we have the issue of CDC/Dearborn critiera. There have been some abitrary cut off about the number of bands on the Western Blot that are required to produce a positive result, based on completely flawed science, and the reponse by the CDC has been to simply tighten and tighen the critera for a positive diagnosis, in order to counteract internet hysteria.

All of these issues raise serious concerns about the validity of the blood test. There are many patients who have exactly the same set of symptoms and circumstances following a tick bite, yet some are positive and some are not.

Many people who are positive on the blood test can be dismissed as having a "false positive" - statistically this is rare, or "treated", having their concerns about Lyme disase dismissed.

### Other blood tests

The good thing about the 2-tier blood test is that if positive, you will get your illness acknowledged by the NHS, and you can get some treatment.

For people though who failed the blood test, for example if their Western Blot fell short of the diagnosis criteria, then it becomes a diagnosis nightmare. The NHS does not know if you have Lyme disease or not, or could treat you speculatively. But all too often, a negative blood test is considered definitive by the NHS, and you will receive no further treatment, even though many people who fail the test initially can go on to pass it after some treatment and their immunity has built up.

There are other tests available, for example the ELISPOT, which is supposed to be more sensitive, but this is not recognised by the NHS so will not gain you access to any more treatments. You can also test for coninfections, such as babesia, bartonella, ricketsia, analplasma and Chlamydia Pneumoniae, but the problem is that these tests are even more unreliable, and do not gain you access to any more treatment since they are all "cured" by the same antiobiotics used to cure Lyme disease and if the patient says otherwise then they should stop whinging.

One test that can be quite useful is the CD3+/CD57- test. Again, the NHS does not use this information for anything, but can measure how immunosuppressed a patient is, and can be used to track your recovery.

## Treatment

Once Lyme disease has been diagnosed, a GP can prescribe treatment. Typically this consists of 3 weeks of the antiobiotic doxycycline. Often, patients will make a full recovery during this period.
